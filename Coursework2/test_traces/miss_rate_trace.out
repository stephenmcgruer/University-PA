# This trace file tests the tracking of miss rates.

# Comments in this file assume the default 128 cache lines and 4 words/line.

# 20 accesses, split into: 3 read misses, 7 read hits, 5 write misses, 5 write
# hits.

# Correct stats should be:
#   Miss rate: (3 + 5) / 20 = 8 / 20 = 40%
#   Read miss rate: 3 / 10 = 30%
#   Write miss rate: 5 / 10 = 50%
