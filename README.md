# Parallel Architectures

This repository contains my coursework for the 5th Year [Parallel Architectures](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/pa/) course, taken in 2012/2013. There were three pieces of coursework for the PA course. The first was a critical evaluation of a number of papers from 1997 that proposed different futures for computer architectures. The second and third courseworks centered around simulating cache coherence protocols.

Coursework for other courses can be found in my main [University Coursework](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University) repository.
