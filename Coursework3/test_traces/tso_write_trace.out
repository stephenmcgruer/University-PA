# This trace file tests latency tracking for TSO writes.

P0 W 0 # Placed in write buffer, retired.
P0 W 1 # Placed in write buffer.
P0 W 2 # Write buffer size exceeded, initiate drain: 222 * 3 = 666 cycles.
P0 W 3 # Placed in write buffer, retired.
P0 R 4 # Read miss, 223 cycles (hides latency of retired write)

# Total: 666 + 223 = 889 cycles
